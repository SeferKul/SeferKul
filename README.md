### Hello there,

  I'm Sefer Kul. I'm an Industrial Engineering Student at EskiÅŸehir Technical University. To quickly sum up, despite my field, I'm highly interested in tech and it seems like I'm gonna completely change my career path this way. Although I will completely turn my career on this path, I also try to benefit as much as possible from the competencies I have acquired from my field.

  I developed several projects for personal interests and school projects. I want to advance professionally in the field of web development. But it seems that I will continue to follow fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality as a hobby. 
  
### Currently Working on ðŸ”­
  Currently, I'm developing an Inventory Management System for the Ford Otosan Eskisehir plant using ASP.NET Core, Ef core, and MsSql for the backend and Js with a little help from JQuery for Frontend. Although I can't share it publicly, I can talk about the requirements of this project and the experience I gained:

- Since it will be in the factory environment, the battery of the tablet may run out. Therefore, in addition to being able to work offline, the application must be able to keep or access the previous count data. I've handled that part of building a suitable controller and a basic one-to-many table relation.
- I used fetch API to send data client to server without page refreshing.
- On the frontend, user interaction and controls were provided using javascript for actions like listening to user inputs, making calculations, changing cells colors, etc...



### My repos ðŸ’¬ 
You can find several algorithm solutions on my Github repo. I made quick explanations about them but still couldn't find time to explain them briefly. But in case you are interested in them please feel free to reach me on my LinkedIn or Instagram.
